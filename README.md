# Hang_Man_Game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess brings them closer to losing, as a stick figure is drawn step by step on a gallows. The goal is to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn.
